# Portfolio Activity: Conduct a security audit, Part 2

## Activity Overview

In part two of this activity, you will communicate the security audit results and recommendations to stakeholders. You can include the completed stakeholder memorandum in your cybersecurity portfolio to demonstrate your ability to communicate in a way that supports stakeholder understanding of complex concepts. To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating your portfolio, read [Create a cybersecurity portfolio](https://www.coursera.org/learn/manage-security-risks/resources/pyALD).

To complete this activity, you will need the **controls assessment** and **compliance checklist** that you worked on in [the previous activity about conducting a security audit](https://www.coursera.org/learn/manage-security-risks/exam/TMBj8/portfolio-activity-conduct-a-security-audit-part-1). If you have not completed that activity, you can revisit it now.

Be sure to complete this activity and answer the questions that follow before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity and answered the questions.

## Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

*This scenario is based on a fictional company:*

Botium Toys’ IT manager asked you to conduct an internal audit of the company’s assets, controls, and adherence to compliance regulations and standards. Then, based on the company’s current goals and level of risk, she requested that you complete a controls assessment and compliance checklist to identify and explain ways that the company can improve its security posture. 

Your task is to clearly and concisely communicate your findings and recommendations to the IT manager and other stakeholders, so they can implement the necessary controls and create appropriate documentation, processes, and procedures to ensure business continuity, the safety of critical assets, and compliance.

### Step 2: Analyze audit results

Review the **controls assessment** and **compliance checklist** you completed in “Conduct a security audit, part 1” and consider the following, before moving on to the next step:

- What were the audit scope and goals? 

- What were the *critical findings* of the audit that need to be addressed immediately (i.e., What controls and/or policies need to be implemented immediately)?

- What were the *findings* (i.e., What controls and/or policies that need to be addressed in the future)?

- How can you summarize your recommendations clearly and concisely to stakeholders?

### Step 3: Communicate results and recommendations

Consider your responses to the questions in step 2, and refer to your completed controls assessment and compliance checklist. Then, use the provided template to communicate your findings and recommendations to stakeholders.

### What to Include in Your Response

Be sure to address the following elements in your completed activity:

- A high-level summary of the **audit scope** is provided (4-6 sentences or bullet points)

- A high-level summary of the **audit goals** is provided (4-6 sentences or bullet points)

- **Critical findings** are listed and explained

- Other **findings** are listed and explained
